Cake decorating is one of my MANY hobbies and I tried to make a business out of it a few years back. I have a FB page and business cards - but I never had a website. So I was really excited to do that for this project. Because this site doesn’t have all of it’s layers yet - at this point, it is just selling the pre-made fondant decorations as a set - so you would order a plain cake from a bakery and add the decorations yourself. 

I'm very happy with the way everything turned out, but the red & white striped header is my pride and joy. I couldn't drop in a jpg, because it needed to be responsive. I researched and taught myself about SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). I had vector graphics in the design world, didn’t know I had them here.
